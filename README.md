## **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**



It is a MERN stack project which is mainly about the various security policies and compliance of the products. This is an integrated framework for security requirements identification and assessment which can help organizations ensure that their products meet security and compliance requirements. Main process is to assess the product's security and compliance against the identified requirements. This can be done by conducting vulnerability assessments which is questionnaire driven. The main objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of current state of product’s security and recommend the security requirements based on the assessment.

This helps the organizations to understand the security requirement of their products by selecting the appropriate standards like NIST, ISO or CIS. This approach is intended to help the organizations to proactively develop more secure and compliant products while reducing the time and effort required to achieve compliance later in the product life cycle. It offers a set of principles to evaluate and enhance the security status of the product, with the aim of enabling a zero trust approach. It enables the product team to ensure that the product’s security level is regularly updated and recommendations are made based on its current security levels.

## **MATURITY LEVEL**

This is mainly used to determine the maturity level of the product.
It is determined based on the product attributes given by the user.
There are three levels , if the maturity level of the product is 3 then it includes all the controls of three levels. 
The controls from levels 1 and 2 are included if the level is 2. 
This framework is mainly built using ASVS (APPLICATION SECURITY VERIFICATION STANDARD) policies which has three levels with 14 security categories all together has more than 150 controls.
